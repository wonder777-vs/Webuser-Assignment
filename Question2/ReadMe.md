Question 2: Employee Dashboard Web Application
Goal

To design an Employee Dashboard Web Application that displays performance metrics, allows theme switching, and supports data filtering interactively.

1️ HTML5 – Structure & Layout

We use header, nav, main, and footer elements to structure the dashboard.

Key Features:

Header: Displays dashboard title and theme toggle button.

Main Section: Contains performance metrics displayed using Bootstrap progress bars.

Aside/Filters: Allows users to filter data (department, performance range).

Footer: Shows company copyright.

This structure makes the interface organized and easy to navigate.

2️ CSS3 – Styling & Layout

CSS3 enhances visuals and responsiveness.

CSS Features Used:

Box Model: Manages spacing and alignment of cards and panels.

Rounded Corners: For panels, buttons, and progress bars.

Media Queries: Adjust card size and layout for smaller screens.

Transitions: Smooth animations when hovering or switching themes.

This ensures a clean and modern appearance on all devices.

3️ JavaScript – Event Handling

JavaScript handles theme switching and form validation.

Key Functionalities:

Theme Toggle: Switches between light and dark themes using classList.toggle().

Interactive Filters: Dynamically updates visible employee data based on user selection.

Data Refresh: Updates the dashboard display without reloading the page.

This creates a dynamic, real-time experience for users.

4️ jQuery – Smooth UI Interactions

jQuery enhances interactivity and transitions.

jQuery Features Used:

Expand/Collapse Panels: Users can toggle visibility of sections.

Filter Animations: Smoothly show/hide filtered employee data.

Fade/Slide Effects: Used for transitions when theme or filters change.

These add a smooth, professional feel to the dashboard.

5️ Bootstrap – Components & Responsiveness

Bootstrap ensures clean layout and responsiveness.

Bootstrap Features Used:

Grid System: Aligns performance cards neatly.

6️ Workflow of Implementation

Here’s how the system flows:

1. Page Structure Creation:

Start with HTML5 structural tags such as header, nav, main, and footer.

In the header, include the dashboard title and a theme switch button (light/dark mode).

Within the main area, use Bootstrap’s grid to organize employee performance cards and filters.

Each card uses <article> to semantically represent a performance summary.

Add progress bars to show individual metrics using Bootstrap’s built-in components.

2. Styling the Layout:

Apply CSS3 for design consistency and visual hierarchy.

Use the box model to space dashboard panels evenly.

Add rounded corners and subtle shadows to cards for depth.

Include transitions for smooth color or theme changes.

Use media queries to rearrange columns into a vertical layout on small screens.

3. Adding Interactivity:

Implement JavaScript for theme switching functionality.

When the user toggles the theme button, JavaScript changes CSS classes between light and dark modes.

Use JS to update displayed performance data dynamically when filters are changed (like department or rating range).

4. Enhancing with jQuery:

Apply slideToggle() and fadeIn()/fadeOut() animations for expanding or collapsing panels.

Smoothly animate dashboard updates when filter options are applied.

Use jQuery for subtle animations to make the theme toggle and data transitions seamless.

5. Responsive Testing:

Check layout behavior using Bootstrap’s grid system on various screen widths.

Ensure performance cards and graphs align properly on tablets and mobile devices.

Verify that the theme switch and progress bars remain functional and readable across all resolutions.

Progress Bars: Show employee performance visually.

Buttons and Navbar: Maintain consistency across screen sizes.

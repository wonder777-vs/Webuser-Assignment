Question 1: Online Event Registration Portal
Goal

To design an Online Event Registration Portal for a technical symposium that allows users to register, view event details, and preview data before submission, while remaining fully responsive across devices.

1️ HTML5 – Structure & Forms

We use semantic HTML5 elements like header, section, and footer for clarity and accessibility.

Key Features:

Registration Form: Uses proper input types (email, tel, date) for accurate data entry.

Datalist: Provides auto-suggestions (for college names or events).

Event Details Section: Displays event info dynamically using JavaScript.

Preview Area: Shows entered data before final submission.

This structure ensures that the webpage is accessible, well-organized, and search-engine friendly.

2️ CSS3 – Styling & Layout

We combine CSS3 and Bootstrap for professional styling and responsiveness.

CSS Features Used:

Box Model: For margins, padding, and consistent layout spacing.

Rounded Corners: Using border-radius for buttons and inputs.

Media Queries: To adjust the layout on mobile devices.

Custom Colors: To make the portal look vibrant and engaging.

This ensures that the registration form and event information look neat and modern across all screen sizes.

3️ JavaScript + jQuery – Behavior & Validation

We make the form interactive using both JavaScript and jQuery.

Interactive Features:

Focus/Blur Events: Highlight active fields.

Form Validation: Check if all fields are filled before submission.

Preview Data: Before submitting, the entered details appear in a preview section.

Dynamic Display: JavaScript updates content instantly without reloading.

This makes the user experience smoother and prevents submission errors.

4️ Bootstrap – Responsiveness Made Easy

Bootstrap is used for a responsive, mobile-first design.

Bootstrap Features Used:

Grid System: Using container, row, and col-md-* for layout alignment.

Buttons: Pre-styled buttons (btn, btn-primary) for actions.

6️ Workflow of Implementation

Here’s how the system flows:

1. Page Structure Creation:

Begin by building the page using semantic HTML5 elements such as header, section, and footer.

Inside the header, place the symposium title and navigation links.

Create a registration form section that includes participant details like name, email, contact number, and event selection using <input> and <datalist>.

Add a preview area below the form to show the entered data dynamically.

Include the Bootstrap CDN links in the head for responsive design and consistent form styling.

2. Styling the Layout:

Use CSS3 to set colors, fonts, spacing, and background.

Apply the box model to manage padding and margins around form fields and event cards.

Add rounded corners and light box shadows for a polished modern look.

Implement media queries to adjust layout and font sizes for mobile users.

3. Adding Interactivity:

Use JavaScript to handle the registration form’s validation and dynamic preview.

Trigger functions on focus and blur events to highlight input fields when users type.

Validate inputs (like email, phone number) before submission.

Use innerHTML to display a preview of user data before final submission.

4. Enhancing with jQuery:

Use jQuery for smooth UI effects like fading the preview section in/out.

Handle submit events with jQuery to validate form fields efficiently.

Add dynamic effects such as highlighting the form border when a field is focused or showing alert animations for success messages.

5. Responsive Testing:

Test the portal layout on different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Ensure that all form elements resize properly using Bootstrap’s grid system.

Confirm that event details and buttons remain accessible and readable on smaller screens.

Forms: Bootstrap’s form controls provide consistent spacing and responsive design.

Together, these ensure that the registration portal looks professional on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
